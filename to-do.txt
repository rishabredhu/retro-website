# TODO Document for Project Optimization

## General Optimization Tasks
- [ ] Review and optimize the Vite configuration for better performance.
- [ ] Implement dynamic imports to reduce initial bundle size.
- [ ] Analyze the current chunk sizes and identify large modules.
- [ ] Adjust `build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks` to improve chunking.
- [ ] Increase `build.chunkSizeWarningLimit` if necessary to suppress warnings.

## Specific Tasks
- [ ] Investigate the use of `"use client"` directive in components and ensure compatibility.
- [ ] Update dependencies to their latest versions to benefit from performance improvements.
- [ ] Refactor components that are causing large bundle sizes.
- [ ] Test the application after each optimization to ensure functionality remains intact.

## Notes
- Consider using tools like Webpack Bundle Analyzer or Vite's built-in analysis tools to visualize the bundle size and identify areas for improvement.
